## P1-P2 Estructura de Computadors - Memory

### Presentation 
This project consists in a group of subroutines programmed in assembly language x86_64, which are called from a C program.

### Competences
- Ability to identifiy the structure elements and the principles of how a computer works
- Ability to analise the arquitecture and organization of chained computing systems and applications 
- Be aware of current and emerging communication technologies and know how to apply conveniently in order to design and develop
solutions based on systems and information technology

### Objectives
Introduction to low level programming, using assembly with Intel x86-64 arquitecture and C.

### Development
This project has to main parts:
- [x] First part: implement in assembly language the corresponding subroutines to the basic functionalities.
- [x] Second part: Implement in assembly language the corresponding subroutines to the additional functionalities needed to
complete all project functionalities. Specially, work in how to pass parameters between the subroutines modifying the implementation
done in the second part.
